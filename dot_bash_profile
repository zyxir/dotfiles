# Environment variables.

# There are a lot of places to set environment variables, but by far setting
# them in .bash_profile (or .zprofile if ZSH is used) is the most consistent
# way.  It works on any distro, and works on Xorg and Wayland alike.

# Setup Fcitx 5 input method.

# You can choose Fcitx 5 as the input method with im-config on Ubuntu, but it
# does not work properly: it sets GTK_IM_MODULE to fcitx instead of fcitx5,
# which causes the candidate list being placed abnormally in GTK applications
# like Firefox (maybe only when Fractional Scaling enabled).  To solve the
# problem, we have to set these environment variables explicitly to fcitx5.
#
# Besides, to start Fcitx 5 at startup, we can execute fcitx5 here, but the list
# of candidates will not show in Firefox (maybe because I'm using the snap
# version of Firefox?).  To solve that, add "Fcitx 5" to Startup Applications
# with GUI, so that it gets loaded later, which fixes my problem.
