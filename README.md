# Dotfiles

My collection of text-based files for configuration or other purposes.

## Installation

Most files can be installed via the ~install.py~ script (currently support Windows and Linux).  Other files that require manual intervention are in the `manual` directory:

- `manual/clash/clash_parsers.yaml`: Parsers for **Clash for Windows**.

## Not Installed Files

These files are no longer used, but are kept for reference:

- `shell/zsh`: I only use bash now for maximum compatibility and ease of setup.
